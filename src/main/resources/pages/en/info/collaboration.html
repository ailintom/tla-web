      <p>The publication platform <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> (<i>TLA</i>) is edited by the Academies’ <a href="project">project</a> “Strukturen und Transformationen des Wortschatzes der ägyptischen Sprache: Text- und Wissenskultur im Alten Ägypten” (“Structure and Transformation in the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language: Texts and Knowledge in the Culture of Ancient Egypt”) (2013-2034). It is a constantly growing anthology of Egyptian texts from all phases of Egyptian language history. External collaborators have contributed much to the <a href="lemma-lists">lemma lists</a> and the <a href="text-corpus">corpus</a> of the <i>TLA</i> project from its very beginning, enlarging the quantity and enhancing the quality of the data.</p>
      <p>The enormous amount of preserved Egyptian texts (an estimated 5 million word tokens in edited hieroglyphic and hieratic texts alone) has required and will continue to require extensive collaboration with other Egyptological projects, institutions, and individual researchers. The <i>TLA</i> project welcomes and encourages collaboration. Researchers in the field of Egyptology and Coptic Studies are invited to publish digital encodings of ancient Egyptian texts on the freely accessible platform <i>TLA</i>, thereby contributing to one of the largest digital text repositories in Egyptology. There are two modes of cooperation: (i) sharing digital text data (notably Egyptological transliteration and translations, but also hieroglyphic transcription in <i>Manuel de Codage</i>) or (ii) editing text themselves. Scholars who offer to add texts to the <i>TLA</i> themselves can work with a free copy of the project’s input software <a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/berlin-text-system" target="_blank"><i>Berlin Text System</i></a> (<i>BTS</i>) on their own computers (unfortunately only available for <i>MS Windows</i> at present). The <i>TLA</i> editors guarantee full credits and explicit acknowledgement of collaboration and collaborators. <strong>If you are interested in a collaboration, please contact</strong> one of the two Research Coodinators, <a href="https://www.saw-leipzig.de/de/mitarbeiter/dilsp" target="_blank">Peter Dils</a>
         (Leipzig) or <a href="https://www.bbaw.de/die-akademie/mitarbeiterinnen-mitarbeiter/werning-daniel" target="_blank">Daniel Werning</a> (Berlin).</p>
      <p>The <i>TLA</i> owes much to cooperating institutions—projects and individual researchers—who have supported our project over the decades of its development. For ongoing and past cooperations with institutions and projects and collaborations of individual researchers, see <a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/projekt/kooperation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
